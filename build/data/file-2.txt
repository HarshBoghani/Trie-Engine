global xpress satellite uses dozens beams provide 50 megabytes per second bandwidth commercial plane flying earth key feature satellite system operates ka part spectrum s roughly 30 gigahertz s extremely high frequency technically consider cell phones use frequencies low thousands megahertz fm radio uses spectrum 85 110 megahertz radio measured kilohertz even satellite communication norms ka band substantially higher frequency ku band used many satellites today one massive acrimonious debates ve never heard going ka ku proponents pushing technology higher throughput satellite communications ku tried true ka newer less congested allows smaller powerful data beams suffice say inmarsat honeywell solution global ka band option gogo s next generation tech uses ku band viasat s second generation tech uses ka less blanket coverage honeywell obviously stands ka band proponents one reason bandwidth high frequencies allow pass lot traffic lander said s tradeoff higher frequency
